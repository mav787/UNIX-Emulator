The implementation of PA2 part 1 is done by declaring both connectInner() and disconnectInner() synchronized to gain mutual exclusion and get protected as critical sections. Further details are also added to these two methods to meet the requirements and keep the invariance not violated.
The “speed” field of a client is set to 9 by default. The implementation of part 1 passes all tests in BehaviorTest and SimulationTest.Basic_Server_Test.
